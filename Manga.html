First I have my favorite anime of all, Naruto, 
and on the next ones I have the drawings I made<br>
</p>


<h2 hidden id="1">
<img src="Immagini/NAR2.jpg" height=500;
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
This is the first one I made about Naruto, and<br>
I really like how it came out.
</h2>


<p hidden id="2">
<img src="Immagini/NAR6.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
Then here you have a coloured version, and I<br>
think for how it ended up it was insanely good.
</p>


<p hidden id="3">
<img src="Immagini/NAR3.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
I feel like the colors in this one made it a lot<br>
better, probably one of my best ones.
</p>

<p hidden id="4">
<img src="Immagini/NAR4.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
I really liked the idea on this one, but<br>
unfortunately, it didn't come out as I wanted it to<br>
the chin on the face doesn't look proportional
</p>

<p hidden id="5">
<img src="Immagini/NAR5.jpg" height=500;
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
For this one I tried to combine different characters<br>
it's the face of one of my favorite characters in a<br>
really cool moment, but with the powers of the main<br>
character. The face look too long also in this one.
</p>

<p hidden id="6">
<img src="Immagini/NAR7.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
This is more of a quick drawing of one of my favorite<br>
characters, I started by doing just the eye, and <br>
that's where my focus was, I think the eyes here are<br>
perfect.
</p>

<p hidden id="7">
<img src="Immagini/NAR8.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
Probably the one I am most proud of, I had these<br>
worn out shoes and decided to make something of them.<br>
This is not the final result, but you can't really see all the<br>
shoe and it's hard to catch on a picture. I have been using<br>
these shoes for almost two year since I drew on them!
</p>

<p hidden id="8">
<img src="Immagini/NAR9.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
This is one of my most recent ones, I love it, <br>
it shows two of my best characters when they were<br>
part of the same team in the Anbu black ops.
</p>

<p hidden id="9">
<img src="Immagini/OP1.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
This is the other show for which I made drawings, <br>
love the story, but I don't believe it is quite<br>
as good as Naruto. Even if I love both of them<br>
really much.
</p>

<p hidden id="10">
<img src="Immagini/OP2.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
First one I made on this manga I read, pretty cool<br>
but not one of my best ones.
</p>

<p hidden id="11">
<img src="Immagini/OP3.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
I think this one came out really good even<br>
if I didn't use colors, it really pictures<br>
the emotions the character was going through<br>
during the moment.
</p>

<p hidden id="12">
<img src="Immagini/OP4.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
Quick sketch, didn't do too much. But still<br>
like it a lot since it was one of the best<br>
moments in the manga.
</p>

<p hidden id="13">
<img src="Immagini/OP6.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
This one was made on a request for a friend<br>
and this is the part before using colors.
</p>

<p hidden id="14">
<img src="Immagini/OP7.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
And here I added the colors, making it one<br>
of the best ones I made. My friend LOVED it!
</p>

<p hidden id="15">
<img src="Immagini/OP5.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
I have to say this one is one of the hardest<br>
ones I have ever made, but it looks awesome!!!
</p>

<p hidden id="16">
<img src="Immagini/MG1.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
This is the third longest manga I have read<br>
I like it a lot, but I haven't made any drawings<br>
for it.
</p>

<p hidden id="17">
<img src="Immagini/MG2.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
I watched the anime for this one, and <br>
altought it was only 24 episodes it was<br>
a really good one.
</p>

<p hidden id="18">
<img src="Immagini/MG3.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
I both watched it and read it, first I watched<br>
and caught up with how much they made and then<br>
I read what was left. The animations were probably<br>
the best ones I have ever seen in any anime.
</p>

<p hidden id="19">
<img src="Immagini/MG4.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
For this one I read the manga, kind of a weird<br>
story, but good plot. I liked it but I wouldn't<br>
say I liked it as much as others.
</p>

<p hidden id="20">
<img src="Immagini/MG5.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
Read the manga, one of the ones I enjoyed the most<br>
loved the idea and the execution, it is 200 something<br>
chapters and I finished it in 3 days. AMAZING!!
</p>

<p hidden id="21">
<img src="Immagini/MG6.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
Same as the last one, crazy good, story amazing. Same<br>
with character development and finished this one too in<br>
just three days. Can't wait for the anime to come out<br>
next year.
</p>

<p hidden id="22">
<img src="Immagini/MG7.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
I read the manga, and it is pretty good, it is <br>
the continuation of my favorite anime, but I wouldn't say<br>
it is nearly as good as Naruto. And they nerfed some of <br>
my favorite characters from the original show, so <br>
points off for that.
</p>

<p hidden id="23">
<img src="Immagini/MG8.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
Perfect, to the very last detail of it. My second<br>
most favorite anime I have watched. It is only 37 <br>
episodes, but the mind games between Light and L is <br>
just top tier.
</p>

<p hidden id="24">
<img src="Immagini/MG9.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
Perfect, to the very last detail of it. The story,<br>
the world building, the character development, and<br>
anything that happends make it one of the best ones.<br>
Three of its episode are ranked in the top 5 episodes<br>
in any TV show, with the other two spots taken from<br>
Breaking Bad. (Another goated show)
</p>

<p hidden id="25">
<img src="Immagini/MG10.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
Really like the story, adn a huge unexpected twist<br>
towards the end. The concept of having a guy with no<br>
magic in a world where your power is based on magic<br>
and having him want to become the strongest wizard<br>
in his kingdom is realy cool!
</p>

<p hidden id="26">
<img src="Immagini/MG11.jpg" height=500; 
	style="border:solid; color:orange;"></img><br>
One of the funniest animes I have watched, the main<br>
character is just an overpowered character who is<br>
"Just a hero for fun" and he literally wins every fight<br>
with just one punch. The anime towards the end gets a <br>
little sad, but still really good. The quality of the<br>
drawings in the manga were the best ones I have seen
