	I started playnig volleyball when I was 13 years old, and<br>
	since then I haven't stopped playing it.<br>
	I currently play at Vanguard, where I also played last year<br>
	winning 3rd place in the nation.<br>
	I have a lot of accomplishments with volleyball,<br>
	including a national title with my old Italian volleyball<br>
	club. But that wasn't all, we also finished second in a <br>
	world level competition, called Cornacchia World Cup.

	I started trying to 3D sculpt in the past five months,<br>
	even if I didn't have much time to work with it I still <br>
	tried to get some little projects for fun, and if you click<br>
	<big><a href="Blender.html" target="_blank">HERE</a></big>
	<br>
	you will open a new page where I share some images of <br>
	what I did, and give my opinion on what I think of it.</td>
	
	<td>
	<p>With science I always had a lot of fun exploring it,<br>
	and just recently I started reading books.<br>
	I always had a lot of fun just watching documentaries<br>
	and how youtube videos on how things were built,<br>
	and if you want to hear more about what science means<br>
	for me you can go at my carrers page and check it out.</p>

	Just recently I have been having fun programming<br>
	with Javascript and HTML, I made a couple of projects<br>
	that we were not supposed to do. I also tried<br>
	to expand some of the ones we were doing in class.<br>
	For example I did a full page with moving bacground<br>
	and full of images for a restaurant that I have been to.<br>
	I also tried (successfully) to make a slot machine,<br>
	that is fully working<br>
