	<h3>Before playing volleyball I played a lot of sports, looking for the one that I liked the most.<br>
	Before volleyball the one that I loved was basketball, but one summer I wanted to try volleyball<br>
	(since my <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Meoni" target="_blank">
	dad</a> was a really good professional volleyball player, with medals in the olympic games).<br>
	So I tried volleyball for the first time, and I just fell in love with it.<br>
	I played volleyball at a minicamp, where we would go and practice in the morning, <br>
	get lunch and, practice again in the afternoon. It was 2 weeks long and I got to know some new<br>
	people that still now some of my best friends!

	This was my first year playing volleyball, and I didn't know this, but I joined one of the best
	teams in Italy, and I didn't get to play a lot. I only got to play when we were up by a lot of<br>
	points, but since our team was really good, we won our regional championship!

	This year our team was even better, but since we still had the same team we were even better.<br>
	I still didn't get to play too much, but this year was the first cathegory were we can go to<br>
	nationals, and we WON!! We were so happy, we couldn't believe we actually won!<br>
	I also got to play in some pool play and I got the last point against the team that we also<br>
	ended up playing in the finals!

	<h3 style="text-align:right">
	This year we had to play with also guys one year older than us becuse U15 doesn't exist in Italy.
	I got a lot better during this year, and I got a lot more playing time during this year, I also got 
	to play a lot during nationals. Unfortunately, we didn't play good in the quarter finals.	
	We underestimated the team too much, to they point of losing against them.
	After that game we were depressed and didn't play good at all for the rest of the nationals,
	ending up finishing 8th in the nation.
	Even if that is not what we wanted, we still got a really good result!

	<h3>We didn't play really good this year, we didn't qualify for nationals so we didn't get<br>

	go to practice in a team that select the best people from the region (in comparison to the<br>
	US is like saying states). And I got to practice with them a lot, I almost made the team<br>
	that plays a high level torurnament. Every region has their own team and they play against

	This was one of my favorite years, for the first half of the season I didn't get<br>
	to play a lot, but I was working really hard, and my coach saw that, and when I was<br>
	going in for one of the starters I would always do better than him. So, mid-season<br>
	he decided to give me an opportunity as a starter, and I killed it! So after that he<br>
	kept me in and I was doing good all year, so this was the frist time I managed to<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	get a starting position! Unfortunately this turned out to be my last year with this team.
	I loved every single one of my teammates, they were like a second family for me.
	I also got to join our team in a world tournament, were we played against national<br>
	teams, and for how good we were we finished second in the world!

	Unfortunately, for COVID we didn't get to play too much. We played only one team seven<br>

	<h3> For my second year at Vanguard we had some new players coming in, but we didn't<br>
	lose anyone, and since last year we finished third we expected to do really good.<br>
	During pre-season we did really good beating some of the best Division 1 teams! <br>
	When we started the actual season our main player got injured, but luckily we still<br>
	did an amazing job, beating almost every team we played, and also the team that won <br>
	against us at nationals the year before! Unfortunately when the guy that got injured<br>
	came back we started going downhill. I had a fracture on my shins and still played through<br>
	it, and the setter was not making smart decisions, we lost during the conference semifinals<br>
	but since we played great during the year we were still able to qualify for nationals<br>
	since we were ranked first in the US. At nationals we lost in the quarter finals, so <br>
	we got fifth place. Not what we expected/wanted but still a good result.

	This year I started playing for the men's volleyball club at UT, and
	the level of competition I was used to is not the<br>
	same, but I met some amazing people and it is still really fun to play. 
	Our season hasn't started yet, but our team is<br>
	looking really good compared to some teams that we
	played during preseason. In every tournement that we played<br>
	we managed to get into the final, except our last tournament, 
	but for a team with three new players it is a huge achievement. I am also
	a practice player for the women's NCAA D1 team, and they are amazing, we were able to win<br>
	the National Championship title!
